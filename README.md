# Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms

An academic project in which we worked on Data Structure creation, management and exploitation like Tree and Graph. To understand the subject and instructions, take a look to the [ADSA_MiniProblem](https://github.com/kevinnclas/ADSA_Project/blob/main/ADSA_MiniProblem.pdf) file, and go to [ADSA_MiniProblem_Report](https://github.com/kevinnclas/ADSA_Project/blob/main/ADSA_MiniProblem_Report.pdf) file to see our choices and work methods.
